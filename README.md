# 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Color Analyzer

This project is an AI-powered computer vision application designed to detect vehicles in images and analyze their visual attributes. The system leverages modern object detection techniques to identify vehicles and applies image processing methods to determine vehicle colors.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical integration of deep learning and classical computer vision for real-world visual analysis tasks.

## ✅ Features

- Vehicle detection using Ultralytics YOLO
- Automatic vehicle localization in images
- Vehicle color analysis
- Interactive Streamlit web interface
- Real-time image processing

## 🧠 How It Works

The application processes an input image by first performing vehicle detection using a YOLO-based model. Once vehicles are identified, the detected regions are analyzed to extract dominant color information using computer vision techniques.

This hybrid approach combines deep learning for object detection with efficient image processing for attribute analysis.
